KnxWeb
======

This project allows you to control your EIB/Knx installation through a WEB interface.
It's using "linknx" for backend server.


Under construction :

This repository is a migration of the legacy one hosted on Sourceforge
( http://linknx.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/linknx/knxweb/knxweb2/ )

The migration is aimed at simplifying the collaboration and maintenance of
Linknx's source code in the future.

The migration process is still under progress. A clearer communication through
the usual KNX forums will happen once it is completed.
